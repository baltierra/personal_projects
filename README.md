# Personal Projects

Repository to publicly share some projects that I have developed in a work or academic context, as well as personal interests. In the different folders you will find projects related to databases, back-end development (and data transformation), machine learning, web development and programming in general.

Below I provide a brief description of the content of each project.

1. **Astronomy**: Here is a Jupyter Notebook for visualizing data from the MaNGA (*Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory*) survey, which maps the spatially-resolved spectroscopy of a large sample of nearby galaxies. The code reads FITS files that contain the flux, inverse variance, mask, and wavelength arrays for a MaNGA data cube and a MaNGA RSS (reduced spectra) file. It then creates plots of the flux as a function of wavelength for the central fiber of the RSS data and a 2D image of the H-alpha emission line for a selected *spaxel* in the data cube.
2. **Aws+Parallel**: A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that review the basis of parallel computing using GPU and fundamentals of AWS (Lambda functions, DynamoDB and Python boto3).
3. **Backend**: Here I showcase three back-end projects. Two are API implementation projects, and one is an ETL implementation project that I did for the UNDP.
4. **DataViz**: Inside this folder there are two directories: one contains data visualization projects in D#.js framework; the other one has a python project that includes data scrapping, analysis and visualization with 202 election data.
5. **MachineLearning**: Inside this folder there are several projects on machine learnings and some homeworks I completed while taking the Machine Learning class in the MSc in Computational Analysis at the University of Chicago. I would like to highlight the *trollbane* project, a collaborative work that implements Natural Language Processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis over Twitter data.
6. **PythonGeneral**: This directory showcases general python developments like game programming, the implementation of a search engine, a web crawler and a statistical classifier.
7. **WebDev**: This folder includes web development projects in React, HTML and Javascript. In React I present a simple calculator, a movie search engine and a locator for Divvy stations. In HTML+JS, I showcase a simplified blackjack browser game and a simple website.
