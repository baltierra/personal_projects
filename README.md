# Personal Projects

Repository to publicly share some projects that I have developed in a work or academic context, as well as personal interests. In the different folders you will find projects related to databases, back-end development (and data transformation), machine learning, web development and programming in general.

Below I provide a brief description of the content of each project.

1. **Astronomy**: Here is a Jupyter Notebook for visualizing data from the MaNGA (*Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory*) survey, which maps the spatially-resolved spectroscopy of a large sample of nearby galaxies. The code reads FITS files that contain the flux, inverse variance, mask, and wavelength arrays for a MaNGA data cube and a MaNGA RSS (reduced spectra) file. It then creates plots of the flux as a function of wavelength for the central fiber of the RSS data and a 2D image of the H-alpha emission line for a selected *spaxel* in the data cube.
2. **Aws+Parallel**: A collection of Jupyter Notebooks that review the basis of parallel computing using GPU and fundamentals of AWS (Lambda functions, DynamoDB and Python boto3).
3. **Backend**
4. **DataViz**
5. **MachineLearning**
6. **PythonGeneral**
7. **WebDev**
