# ABOUT THE PROCESS

I am interested into the environmental topic because of its relevance today. We are facing a not very promising future in terms of climate. The climate change is an issue and over time has done nothing but get worst. So I decided to take a look over of the effect of an important environmental agreement on the OECD countries, regarding the greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions.

Regarding data, I also thought about using sources from Climate Change Knowledge Portal and Open Environmental Data Project, but in the end I decided to use [OECD statistics site](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=air_ghg). I made this decision because the data there was only about the countries I was interested in, and also it was easy to download in CSV format.

When it comes of defining the story, that was the hardest part. I always knew that my story will be defined once I did exploratory data analysis, and it was. I started by wanting to find any significant patter in the GHG decrease over time. After the initial analysis I found some interesting facts: USA have a great GHG emission rate, way larger than the countries that follows them, and European countries have a better performance in the GHG decrease. I firs thought about making a story regarding the G7 countries, by finally I decided to do a story regarding the Tokio Agreement as the change agent on the GHG emissions over the last 30 years.

Regarding data gaps, fortunately there is not, except with Israel. So I decided to take Israel out of the analysis, but for the rest of the countries data was complete.

About the charts I used, I chose what I thought to be more significant to display time evolving data, and subcategories among data. This is very helpful to understand the evolution of the GHG emissions, along with responsibilities of each countries in total amounts per year.

Finally, and regarding the coding, beyond the challenges that D3 put over this assignment, the Python data analysis was in some cases difficult, particularly when I wanted to generate json files to use in my "treemaps". But, of course, I learned a lot in the process.
